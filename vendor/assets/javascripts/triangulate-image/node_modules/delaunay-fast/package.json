  "readme": "This is just a quick little implementation of [Delaunay Triangulation][1] in\nJavaScript. It was mostly ported from [Paul Bourke's C implementation][2], but\nI referenced some bits from [another JavaScript implementation][3] and rewrote\na bunch of things in ways more amenable to fast JavaScript execution.\n\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation\n[2]: http://paulbourke.net/papers/triangulate/\n[3]: http://www.travellermap.com/tmp/delaunay.htm\n\nNotably, it runs in subquadratic time, making it the fastest JavaScript\nimplementation of which I'm aware. (Okay, it doesn't really, but it'd be\ntrivial to modify to run in subquadratic time, I just havn't done so yet.)\n\nThis software is released into the public domain.\n",
